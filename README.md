😄 Hi, this is **CPSea**, a large-scale cyclic peptide-protein complex dataset derived from AlphaFold Database. We hope that you can always find the right part out of the CPSea to fulfill your requirements. 🌊

🗺️ This GitHub site is mainly for scripts that generate and evaluate the dataset, as well as the evaluation of target-conditioned cyclic peptide design models that are trained solely on CPSea. Check out our Kaggle and Zenodo sites for clean data:

Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziyiyang180104/cpsea](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziyiyang180104/cpsea)

Zenodo: [https://zenodo.org/records/16417466](https://zenodo.org/records/16417466)

The main body of CPSea has been compressed and divided into chunks. You can extract complexes by running

` bash untar_CPSea.sh /path/to/target/directory `

We also provide list files containing names of CPSea and its subsets, metadata files containing the results of evaluation, and scripts for evaluation
and subset curation.
