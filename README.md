ðŸ˜„Hi, this is CPSea, a large-scale cyclic peptide-protein complex dataset derived from AlphaFold Database.

The main data of CPSea has been compressed and divided into chunks. You can extract complexes by running

` bash untar_CPSea.sh /path/to/target/directory `

We also provide list files containing names of CPSea and its subsets, metadata files containing the results of evaluation, and scripts for evaluation
and subset curation. We hope that you can always find the right part out of the CPSea to fulfill your requirements. ðŸŒŠ
