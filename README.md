😄 Hi, this is **CPSea**, a large-scale cyclic peptide-protein complex dataset derived from AlphaFold Database. We hope that you can always find the right part out of the CPSea to fulfill your requirements. 🌊

🗺️ This GitHub site mainly focuses on scripts and tutorials dataset generation and evaluation, as well as the evaluation of target-conditioned cyclic peptide design models that are trained on CPSea. Check out our Kaggle and Zenodo sites for clean data and relevant files:

Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziyiyang180104/cpsea](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziyiyang180104/cpsea)

Zenodo: [https://zenodo.org/records/16417466](https://zenodo.org/records/16417466)

## Download Current Datasets

We store the main body of datasets in Kaggle and Zenodo. To download clean data of datasets, run:

`curl -C - -o CPSea.zip https://zenodo.org/api/records/16417466/files-archive`

In which are CPSea datasets derived from AFDB and PDB.


## Dataset Generation

🚧 We will release the soure codes for data generation after publishing our paper ~

## Dataset Evaluation and Subset Curation 

### Structure Validity
